A Cardano Music Token Repertory Project


By indexing CIP-25 audio tokens, with a focus on CIP-60 tagged assets, Arp Radio seeks to create new ways of interacting with such tokens to grow outreach and provide a more streamlined interface for listening.  

Built using Next.js, the web application codebase is open source, albeit without necessary stack components like a Cardano node, transaction indexers, IPFS clusters/nodes, SQL databases, etc.
